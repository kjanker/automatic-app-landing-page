# Privacy Policy
Friendtain respects your privacy and that of your contacts.
Friendtain has servers and does not collect any data - everything stays on your iPhone.

<br>

## Collection of Personal Information
All information you enter in Friendtain is stored locally on your iPhone.
Friendtain does not collect, store, or share any of your provided data.

<br>

## Access to iOS contacts
To get the most of Friendtain, I recommend granting access to contacts. This allows Friendtain to stay in sync and allow quick access to linked contacts. As with all other information entered in Friendtain, this data never leaves your phone.

If you email the developer for support or other feedback, the emails with email addresses will be retained for quality assurance purposes. The email addresses will be used only to reply to the concerns or suggestions raised and will never be used for any marketing purpose without your consent.
